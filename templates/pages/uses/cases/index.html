              <h2>Operations Dashboard (Lundin)</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Challenge: </strong>Lundin Norway operations wanted a set of dashboards that would give everyone both onshore
                and offshore a quick and easy way to find out the status of operations on the Edvard Grieg and Brynhild assets.
                <p>
                  <strong>What we did: </strong>Eigen connected the Ingenuity platform to 5 different systems and designed a set
                  of elegant, interactive dashboards using modern web technologies.
                  <p>
                    <strong>Result: </strong>Within 30 seconds anyone can get an understanding of what is happening offshore. Previously
                    this could take up to 30 minutes. Managers and engineers are able to quickly see what is going on and
                    prioritise work when they get in. Because it is so easy to use, most people in the company now have access
                    and this has helped foster a sense of unity in the team.</article>

                <p>
                  <strong>Challenge:</strong> Keeping on top of essential Safety equipment certification and maintenance was almost
                  impossible because the necessary information was spread across many different systems. Engineers did not
                  have an overview of the status of all safety related equipment and had no easy way of tracking when certification
                  expired and what maintenance was overdue. This affected the integrity of safety barriers (LOPA) and lifting
                  operations.
                  <p>
                    <strong>What we did:</strong> Using Eigen Ingenuity we linked all the different information into our Asset Model
                    and made it searchable and visible in context. The data model incorporated recommendations from SINTEF
                    on how status should be calculated based on criticality and other factors and aggregated up across barrier
                    elements and areas.
                    <p>
                      <strong>Result:</strong> Users are now able to find the status of equipment quickly and easily and click on
                      it's status to see the underlying cause. Status can be aggregated in any direction to create interactive
                      dashboards and KPIs to give management a clear picture of the status of all equipment. By making the
                      information easy to find, users are now able to focus on prioritising work.</div>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Challenge:</strong> Regulatory requirements set a high frequency of well testing such that the reservoir
                    engineering we unable to keep up with the amount of analysis required. As a result, the reservoir models
                    and well performance curves were often out of date, resulting in allocation factors outside compliance
                    requirements and inaccurate production curtailment plans
                    <p>
                      <strong>What we did:</strong> Eigen automated the data capture and initial analysis of the well test data using
                      Eigen+Monitor. Using our web interface the Reservoir Engineers can instantly see which wells have been
                      tested, and which ones need attention first. The Reservoir Engineers can amend the time period of the
                      test, enter lab data and amend incorrect factors before writing validated tests to the Production Reporting
                      System.
                      <p>
                        <strong>Result:</strong> The time taken to analyse a well test has been reduced from 2 hours to 20 minutes.
                        The Reservoir Engineers are able to focus on the most problematic wells first based on the pre-analysis
                        by Eigen+Monitor. The reservoir allocation factors and now within 5% of the metered numbers and within
                        compliance (10%).</div>

                      party vendors to access business critical offshore control systems and packaged equipment.
                      <p>
                        <strong>What we did:</strong> In collaboration with the asset operations team we analysed the operational
                        requirements and developed a Statement of Requirements. We visited the vendors and developed a Functional
                        Design for each system. We engaged the clients network & IT teams to develop a standard architecture
                        that was compliant with ISA99 and leveraged existing facilities for secure remote access to client
                        systems wherever possible. We then tested this with each vendor and installed and commissioned the
                        equipment during the construction phase.
                        <p>
                          <strong>Result:</strong> The onshore teams and remote vendors had full remote access to 13 offshore systems
                          before startup, including the main control system, drilling control system, gas compressors and
                          power management.</div>

                          <strong>Challenge:</strong> Lack of design and uncontrolled connectivity between all parties on drilling
                          rigs was causing downtime and meant there was no consistent history of well data from each campaign.
                          Re-engineer the networks and data-interfaces for an offshore drilling rig so that users could get
                          all the data from one place, in an industry standard format and in a way that is ISA99 compliant.
                          <p>
                            <strong>What we did:</strong> We designed, tested and installed a high availability system using a private

                            and provided secure remote access to offshore systems. We designed an ISA99 compliant architecture
                            to segregate all parties from each other and the control system. The architecture was approved
                            by our clients internal authorities. We carried out extensive testing with all parties involved
                            and installed the system in the construction yard and provided user training.

                          <p>
                            <strong>Challenge:</strong> Sand erosion on valve internals became so bad that the process could no longer
                            be controlled safely.
                            <p>
                              <strong>What we did:</strong> We matched the original vendor calculations for both critical and non-critical
                              flow and then developed an algorithm to calculate the actual Cv and the theoretical Cv, that
                              could be coded to run against the realtime measurements available in the data historian. The
                              results were written back to virtual tags for each valve at risk and an alert configured if
                              they began to diverge.
                              <p>
                                <strong>Result:</strong> By trending the virtual tags, the maintenance team is now able to view the
                                current state of the at risk valves and get early indication of possible wear, allowing them
                                to take preventative action to avoid a safety incident.</div>

                              A new production platform required installation and configuration of a full suite of realtime
                              tools and remote access ready for startup, as well as advanced functionality to meet new regulatory

                                <strong>What we did: </strong>We provided the end-to-end capability from design through to installation
                                and support. We built a multi-disciplined team to support the engineering and operations
                                team during the project phase. We built extensive test systems and attended the Factory Acceptance
                                Tests for connected systems. We installed and configured a technology stack including Data
                                Historians, Alarm &amp; Event Historians, Web Visualisation, a Production Reporting system,
                                web dashboards and overviews and pre-configured workflows (Well Testing, Safe Operating Envelopes,

                                                and barriers from SAP; and the status of Barriers automatically updated from ICSS and SAP WO data. The information is then
                                                visible in context and searchable. The data model incorporated recommendations from SINTEF on how status should be calculated
                                                based on criticality and other factors and aggregated up across barrier elements and areas. Additionally, relevant event

                                              <p>
<strong>Situation:</strong> The hardware, DB (Oracle 9) and OS are obsolete; Matrikon’s ProcessGuard is no longer supported; ProcessNet interface is
not operational; exports to Excel are not compatible with latest Excel; required Alarm Management functionality is not supported.
The result: User experience is very poor and there are cyberattack risks. There is an opportunity to Virtualise.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Challenge:</strong> Replace the entire Alarm Management infrastructure and application stack with latest supported versions and a Java-free web
user interface in an InfoSec compliant virtual environment and migrate the existing historical alarm data to the new system.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Action:</strong> Overall project management and vendor engagement in a Turn Key project to achieve the objectives: Design, Build, Test, Digital
Security architecture and firewall re-configuration, Install &amp; Configure, Decommission the old system, Cut Over, Role assignment,
Training and hand-over to Eigen Support.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Result:</strong> Completed on time on budget with minimum disruption to the business. Very happy Alarm Management users!
