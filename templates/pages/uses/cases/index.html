Previously this could take up to 30 minutes. Managers and engineers are able to quickly see what is going on and prioritise work when they get in. Because it is so easy to use, most people in the company now have access and this has helped foster a sense of unity in the team.</article></div></div></div><li class="showoff-panel loading"><a href=#efficient-work name=efficient-work class=showoff-thumb><div class=loader><div class=uil-ring-css><div></div></div></div><div class=showoff-thumb-hover><div class=showoff-thumb-hover-style><i class="fa fa-eye"></i><p>Efficient Work (ENI)</div></div><img src=/images/case-studies/efficient-work-case-study.jpg alt="Efficient Work"></a><div class=showoff-detail><div class=showoff-detail-wrap><div class="fa fa-times showoff-detail-close"></div><div class=showoff-detail-left><div class=showoff-detail-media><img src=/images/case-studies/efficient-work-case-study.jpg alt="Efficient Work"></div></div><div class=showoff-detail-right><div class=showoff-detail-content><h2>Efficient Work (ENI)</h2><p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Keeping on top of essential Safety equipment certification and maintenance was almost impossible because the necessary information was spread across many different systems. Engineers did not have an overview of the status of all safety related equipment and had no easy way of tracking when certification expired and what maintenance was overdue. This affected the integrity of safety barriers (LOPA) and lifting operations.<p><strong>What we did:</strong> Using Eigen Ingenuity we linked all the different information into our Asset Model and made it searchable and visible in context. The data model incorporated recommendations from SINTEF on how status should be calculated based on criticality and other factors and aggregated up across barrier elements and areas.<p><strong>Result:</strong> Users are now able to find the status of equipment quickly and easily and click on it's status to see the underlying cause. Status can be aggregated in any direction to create interactive dashboards and KPIs to give management a clear picture of the status of all equipment. By making the information easy to find, users are now able to focus on prioritising work.</div></div></div></div><li class="showoff-panel loading"><a href=#well-testing name=well-testing class=showoff-thumb><div class=loader><div class=uil-ring-css><div></div></div></div><div class=showoff-thumb-hover><div class=showoff-thumb-hover-style><i class="fa fa-eye"></i><p>Well Testing</div></div><img src=/images/case-studies/refinery-at-night.jpg alt="Well Testing"></a><div class=showoff-detail><div class=showoff-detail-wrap><div class="fa fa-times showoff-detail-close"></div><div class=showoff-detail-left><div class=showoff-detail-media><img src=/images/case-studies/refinery-at-night.jpg alt="Well Testing"></div></div><div class=showoff-detail-right><div class=showoff-detail-content><h2>Well Testing</h2><p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Regulatory requirements set a high frequency of well testing such that the reservoir engineering we unable to keep up with the amount of analysis required. As a result, the reservoir models and well performance curves were often out of date, resulting in allocation factors outside compliance requirements and inaccurate production curtailment plans<p><strong>What we did:</strong> Eigen automated the data capture and initial analysis of the well test data using Eigen+Monitor. Using our web interface the Reservoir Engineers can instantly see which wells have been tested, and which ones need attention first. The Reservoir Engineers can amend the time period of the test, enter lab data and amend incorrect factors before writing validated tests to the Production Reporting System.<p><strong>Result:</strong> The time taken to analyse a well test has been reduced from 2 hours to 20 minutes. The Reservoir Engineers are able to focus on the most problematic wells first based on the pre-analysis by Eigen+Monitor. The reservoir allocation factors and now within 5% of the metered numbers and within compliance (10%).</div></div></div></div><li class="showoff-panel loading"><a href=#remote-access name=remote-access class=showoff-thumb><div class=loader><div class=uil-ring-css><div></div></div></div><div class=showoff-thumb-hover><div class=showoff-thumb-hover-style><i class="fa fa-eye"></i><p>Remote Access For 3rd Parties</div></div><img src=/images/case-studies/fibre-patch-panel.jpg alt="Remote Access for 3rd Parties"></a><div class=showoff-detail><div class=showoff-detail-wrap><div class="fa fa-times showoff-detail-close"></div><div class=showoff-detail-left><div class=showoff-detail-media><img src=/images/case-studies/fibre-patch-panel.jpg alt="Remote Access for 3rd Parties"></div></div><div class=showoff-detail-right><div class=showoff-detail-content><h2>Remote Access For 3rd Parties</h2><p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Provide a standardised way for onshore support engineering support teams and 3rd party vendors to access business critical offshore control systems and packaged equipment.<p><strong>What we did:</strong> In collaboration with the asset operations team we analysed the operational requirements and developed a Statement of Requirements. We visited the vendors and developed a Functional Design for each system. We engaged the clients network & IT teams to develop a standard architecture that was compliant with ISA99 and leveraged existing facilities for secure remote access to client systems wherever possible. We then tested this with each vendor and installed and commissioned the equipment during the construction phase.<p><strong>Result:</strong> The onshore teams and remote vendors had full remote access to 13 offshore systems before startup, including the main control system, drilling control system, gas compressors and power management.</div></div></div></div><li class="showoff-panel loading"><a href=#new-technology-pilot name=new-technology-pilot class=showoff-thumb><div class=loader><div class=uil-ring-css><div></div></div></div><div class=showoff-thumb-hover><div class=showoff-thumb-hover-style><i class="fa fa-eye"></i><p>New technology pilot</div></div><img src=/images/case-studies/new-technology-pilot-computer-racks.jpg alt="New technology pilot"></a><div class=showoff-detail><div class=showoff-detail-wrap><div class="fa fa-times showoff-detail-close"></div><div class=showoff-detail-left><div class=showoff-detail-media><img src=/images/case-studies/new-technology-pilot-computer-racks.jpg alt="New technology pilot"></div></div><div class=showoff-detail-right><div class=showoff-detail-content><h2>New technology pilot</h2><p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Lack of visibility of chemical dosing quality meant no visibility of barrier effectiveness against pipework corrosion.<p><strong>What we did:</strong> Eigen provided experts in Production Engineering and Technology Development to work as part of a team of specialists over 2 years to develop an online tool to monitor and alert on chemical injection effectiveness.<p><strong>Result:</strong> Our client successfully developed and piloted a chemical management tool that quickly highlighted shortcomings in chemical barrier effectiveness, which were addressed immediately.</div></div></div></div><li class="showoff-panel loading"><a href=#realtime-drilling name=realtime-drilling class=showoff-thumb><div class=loader><div class=uil-ring-css><div></div></div></div><div class=showoff-thumb-hover><div class=showoff-thumb-hover-style><i class="fa fa-eye"></i><p>Realtime Drilling Information System</div></div><img src=/images/case-studies/realtime-drilling-drillrig.jpg alt="Realtime Drilling"></a><div class=showoff-detail><div class=showoff-detail-wrap><div class="fa fa-times showoff-detail-close"></div><div class=showoff-detail-left><div class=showoff-detail-media><img src=/images/case-studies/realtime-drilling-drillrig.jpg alt="Realtime Drilling"></div></div><div class=showoff-detail-right><div class=showoff-detail-content><h2>Realtime Drilling Information System</h2><p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Lack of design and uncontrolled connectivity between all parties on drilling rigs was causing downtime and meant there was no consistent history of well data from each campaign. Re-engineer the networks and data-interfaces for an offshore drilling rig so that users could get all the data from one place, in an industry standard format and in a way that is ISA99 compliant.<p><strong>What we did:</strong> We designed, tested and installed a high availability system using a private cloud running a data hub that supported the industry standard protocols (WITSML, WITS and OPC) and provided secure remote access to offshore systems. We designed an ISA99 compliant architecture to segregate all parties from each other and the control system. The architecture was approved by our clients internal authorities. We carried out extensive testing with all parties involved and installed the system in the construction yard and provided user training.<p><strong>Result:</strong> Our client has a comprehensive archive of realtime drilling data from day one and, because the system was fully compatible with their in-house advance drilling monitoring system, were able to provide full remote monitoring of drilling operations from startup.</div></div></div></div><li class="showoff-panel loading"><a href=#realtime-valve-cv name=realtime-valve-cv class=showoff-thumb><div class=loader><div class=uil-ring-css><div></div></div></div><div class=showoff-thumb-hover><div class=showoff-thumb-hover-style><i class="fa fa-eye"></i><p>Realtime Valve Cv</div></div><img src=/images/case-studies/offshore-steps-eigen.jpg alt="Realtime Valve Cv"></a><div class=showoff-detail><div class=showoff-detail-wrap><div class="fa fa-times showoff-detail-close"></div><div class=showoff-detail-left><div class=showoff-detail-media><img src=/images/case-studies/offshore-steps-eigen.jpg alt="Realtime Valve Cv"></div></div><div class=showoff-detail-right><div class=showoff-detail-content><h2>Realtime Drilling Information System</h2><p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Sand erosion on valve internals became so bad that the process could no longer be controlled safely.<p><strong>What we did:</strong> We matched the original vendor calculations for both critical and non-critical flow and then developed an algorithm to calculate the actual Cv and the theoretical Cv, that could be coded to run against the realtime measurements available in the data historian. The results were written back to virtual tags for each valve at risk and an alert configured if they began to diverge.<p><strong>Result:</strong> By trending the virtual tags, the maintenance team is now able to view the current state of the at risk valves and get early indication of possible wear, allowing them to take preventative action to avoid a safety incident.</div></div></div></div><li class="showoff-panel loading"><a href=#integrated-operations-ready-for-start-up name=integrated-operations-ready-for-start-up class=showoff-thumb><div class=loader><div class=uil-ring-css><div></div></div></div><div class=showoff-thumb-hover><div class=showoff-thumb-hover-style><i class="fa fa-eye"></i><p>Integrated Operations ready for Start Up</div></div><img src=/images/west-chirag.jpg alt="West Chirag"></a><div class=showoff-detail><div class=showoff-detail-wrap><div class="fa fa-times showoff-detail-close"></div><div class=showoff-detail-left><div class=showoff-detail-media><img src=/images/west-chirag.jpg alt="West Chirag"></div></div><div class=showoff-detail-right><div class=showoff-detail-content><h2>Integrated Operations ready for Start Up</h2><p><strong>Challenge: </strong>Deliver all the systems for a new off shore platform ready for startup. A new production platform required installation and configuration of a full suite of realtime tools and remote access ready for startup, as well as advanced functionality to meet new regulatory requirements.<p><strong>What we did: </strong>We provided the end-to-end capability from design through to installation and support. We built a multi-disciplined team to support the engineering and operations team during the project phase. We built extensive test systems and attended the Factory Acceptance Tests for connected systems. We installed and configured a technology stack including Data Historians, Alarm &amp; Event Historians, Web Visualisation, a Production Reporting system, web dashboards and overviews and pre-configured workflows (Well Testing, Safe Operating Envelopes, SIS Demand Auditing).<p><strong>Result: </strong>The reservoir team were able to watch the first well start up from offices onshore and back in the UK. The operations teams offshore and onshore were able to collaborate around live data and vendors were able to get remote access to their packages.</div></div></div></div></ul></div>{{footer}}
