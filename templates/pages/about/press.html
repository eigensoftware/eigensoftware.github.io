                      <h2>Digitalisation approaches – An oil &amp; gas industry blueprint</h2>
                      <h3>
                         How can operators capture greater value through making better digital decisions?
                      </h3>
                      <p>
Much has been written about Digitalisation recently but it’s often less clear that different approaches are needed depending on the nature of the business goal.
</p>
<p>
There are essentially two main types of digitalisation - those focused on using data to make co-ordination decisions to sanction and control work (referred to as Digital Decisions), and those that embed information processing so the way work is performed changes (referred to as Digital Execution).
</p>
<p>
Examples of Digital Decisions include leveraging data that is generated by measuring and recording field operations, combining it in new ways and then generating insights – and physical examples of the Digital Execution include autonomous vehicles, wearable technology, robotics and automated systems.
</p>
<p>
In oil and gas I am seeing most of the Digital Execution innovation being driven through the supply chain with the promise of increased productivity for existing activities. This is accessible to operators through smart procurement and teaming initiatives. Through their own actions, operators have most opportunity to capture value through making better digital decisions.
</p>
<p>
There are different approaches to delivering Digital Decisions that address different problems, and the choice can be intimidating. To address this there are three key considerations to weigh before choosing an approach for an initiative.  Leaders should first ask:
</p>
<p>
1. What stage of life is the oil and gas field;
</p>
<p>
2. Who will use the systems; and
</p>
<p>
3. What’s the primary business case?
</p>
<p>
The stage of life of a field will guide the technology approach to consider. For example, technology that needs to integrate with established ways of working will differ from technologies that can mature along with the design and build of new assets. Assets that are being decommissioned still need instrumentation but not the same as a field in full-blown production.
</p>
<p>
Who uses the systems is also vitally important. Will it be the OIM and the team off-shore; the data analytics department; or the functional expert in head office? This will impact certain important considerations around the interactivity of the systems, power required from analytical super-computing and the level of ‘cleverness’ of any 3D virtual reality representations.
</p>
<p>
If companies place complex analytical tools with sophisticated interfaces into on-line production environments this can cause frustration and result in rejection. This is because they can be seen as distracting and not practical enough to be useful “in the real world”. This can be the case despite the fact that high-end knowledge workers in on-shore analytics roles can use them to add considerable value by understanding what’s going on and then issuing new work instructions to the field. Consider carefully the work-context in which a system will be deployed and how it will be integrated into current ways-of-working.
</p>
<p>
The primary business case must address one of three fundamental value drivers, which are namely:
</p>
<p>
1. Reduce the time to access and then produce the resource;
</p>
<p>
2. Increase the maximum amount of hydrocarbon extracted from the reservoir; or
</p>
<p>
3. Reduce the cost to build and operate the required infrastructure
</p>
<p>
In addition to these three, there are certain ways that owners can maximise their localised value by redistribution of risk and reward through commercial and trading arrangements. And, of course, this must all be bounded by ensuring that HSSE requirements are met.
</p>
<h4>
Technical approach one: Create a Data Warehouse / Data Lake & Plug-in Analytics
</h4>
<p>
This provides the promise of uncovering new insights by using specially trained algorithms to automatically look through past-history to identify previously unrecognised patterns. These patterns may be able to show that different configurations of settings will increase production rates.
</p>
<p>
It’s also possible that they can create better understanding of reservoir conditions by looking at changes in flow-rates and pressures. Or, perhaps, they will find ways to predict when machinery will fail.
</p>
<p>
There are currently two streams of activity underway in this area - one is the creation of “platforms” where data will be stored, organised and made available for use, and the other is in the creation of “analytics” that use techniques like AI and machine learning to access data from the platform to generate insights.
</p>
<p>
There is an obvious compatibility issue here; you don’t want to implement a platform to then find out that everyone has built analytics to work on another one. There are a number of commercial platforms in development and some operators are creating their own in-house ones. The issues that need to be addressed are: Data Representation, Performance and Interoperability.
</p>
<p>
There are many research companies and universities that are working on AI, Prediction and machine learning approaches. There is not yet an established design pattern or dominant set of commercial algorithms, but it is reasonable to expect them to emerge over time and be able to connect to the data platforms.
</p>
<h4>
Technical approach two: Collect Big Data in the Cloud and dig for answers
</h4>
<p>
This is similar in many ways to the data warehouse approach in that data is copied and placed into an area for later use. The purported advantage of this method is the lack of structure required in the data. The cost of creating infrastructure for transmitting and collecting all the sensor data to the centre is justified against the access to general tools and analytics packages that have been developed in other industries.
</p>
<p>
In this area you see solutions such as Amazon web services, Google analytics and IBM’s Watson all being applied in the search for meaning across disparate data sets, without the requirement for detailed engineering know-how to guide the analysis.
</p>
<h4>
Technical approach three: 3D Visualisation and Augmented Reality
</h4>
<p>
A further approach is one which places visualisation at its core. One area where this works especially well when trying to establish the physical relationships between objects when you are not able to actually see them. This may be because the objects are located far out to sea and you are in the office, or it may be because it has not been built yet.
</p>
<p>
Loading data into models from an existing plant can be done through clever laser scanning and picture analysis software. For new plants many of the design packages will automatically create 3D layouts that can be uploaded directly and kept up to date as the plant is built.
</p>
<p>
There are cases where this technology has added value - for instance in new builds, being able to simulate the construction can show the optimum order in which to assemble it, which helps to avoid access issues. During modification work, engineering measurements and fitting instructions can be made without the need for site visits. Augmented Reality offers the promise of accurate on-site equipment identification along with work-orders, associated information and instructions.
</p>
<h4>
Common Challenges
</h4>
<p>
Regardless of the end goal, there are certain prerequisite activities that include: connection to the complex and diverse computer systems used to run operations, whether that is instrumentation data, real-time performance, maintenance records or warehouse inventory; and integration of analysis results into the daily operation routines so that different actions can be taken to deliver business results.
</p>
<p>
Digitalisation initiatives should have ultimate target end-goals that include automation, remote analytics and complex visualisations. Companies should learn how to combine sub-surface analysis with surface operations and how to maximise value through the life of a field from concept, construction, operation and decommissioning.
</p>
<p>
The implementation will be key to gaining value. For all but the largest super-majors it is probably unwise to pursue all three technical approaches at once. For everyone else it’s about choosing a focus, setting an ultimate vision and the deciding how fast and how far to go down the path, while delivering value at each step.
</p>
<p>
Here at Eigen, our approach to digitalisation is to leverage the information that is already available by hooking up existing systems without copying data. We enable engineers to create instinctive work-flows that speed their work. We enable them to create their own real-time based alerting for operations as both companywide standards or temporary personal watch-lists.
</p>
<p>
The rationale behind our approach is that it offers a very rapid way to gain quick access to information and create value quickly. Because our system is built by process engineers we know how to make the data interactive in context which enables investigation work to be carried out directly, without involving IT or having to becoming an expert in a new analytics package.
</p>
<p>
Engineers know what they need and how to make the calculations that help them drive performance. They also know when they need to be alerted. The problem they have is getting hold of the data from across the organisation, applying calculations, setting up a system to watch on their behalf and then rapidly communicating their findings to colleagues. And, of course, the not insignificant problem of integrating their findings into on-going work-programmes. Without our system, this activity is conducted using Excel, Powerpoint, email and a large number of time-wasting group meetings.
</p>
<p>
Combining performance data, instrumentation output and systems of record in ways that make today’s operations come alive, promises quick wins and a an on-ramp to enable other more advanced approaches.  This is all available now without waiting for a break-through discovery, design of a central collection point or changes in departmental responsibilities.

            <h2>Eigen delivers enhanced operational management at Goliat</h2>
<p>
Offshore Oil and Gas digitalisation software provider and systems integrator, Eigen, is delivering a new Barrier Status Panel to improve the management of operational safety on Goliat.
</p>
<p>
Working with ENI Norge, the Barents Sea project will greatly increase the visibility of real-time asset-integrity and risk-stance. This will help operations to reduce the risk of safety incidents and production losses on the platform. The system is due to enter production in April.
</p>
<p>
By implementing the first solution of its kind to restructure the understanding and management of risk, the innovative project will eliminate the time required to identify and analyse safety barrier status. This will enable engineers to focus on other operationally essential activities, whilst complying with health, safety and environmental policies.
</p>
<p>
"This new way of being able to digitally visualise our risk posture in real time will transform our safety and productivity capabilities and is part of a pipeline of further improvement projects as part of our TRACE digital platform.”, said Stein Tyldum, IT/TLC Operation & Projects Manager.
</p>
<p>
With new operators requiring real-time visibility of their barrier status and the tightening legal requirements from regulators, the system extensions co-designed with ENI solves the complex challenges in gathering, processing and presentation of information in operational context.
</p>
<p>
The implementation will transition into support under Eigen’s existing frame agreement with ENI Norge. As part of its wider TRACE project, started in 2016 and built using Eigen’s Ingenuity digitalisation platform, it has been designed to efficiently enhance productivity and reduce the workload of the operations management who are responsible for safety compliance. It will also enable senior managers to comply with legal requirements to maintain and demonstrate safe operations.
</p>
<p>
“TRACE is our new digital platform designed to enhance productivity and reduce the workload of the operations management. It will also enable senior managers to comply with legal requirements to maintain and demonstrate safe operations better than ever before.” said Sture Lygren, Integrated Operations Lead.
</p>
<p>
Commenting from Eigen, Murray Callander, CEO, said,” “We are extremely pleased with the outcome of the project so far. It provides a further benchmark in our mission to enhance industry by delivering innovative and forward-thinking digitalisation projects. By understanding the questions that data must answer, applying our experience with real-time systems and carefully designing human-digital interaction, we have enabled information to be used to change operational practices.
</p>
<p>
This is another example of industry applying technology to in-the-field decision-making, resulting in lower costs, increased safety and enabling the Fourth Industrial Revolution”.

              With new operators requiring real-time visibility of their barrier status and the tightening legal requirements from regulators,
              the system extensions co-designed with ENI solves the complex challenges in gathering, processing and presentation of
              information in operational context.
            </p>
            <p>
              The implementation will transition into support under Eigen’s existing frame agreement with ENI Norge. As part of its wider
              TRACE project, started in 2016 and built using Eigen’s Ingenuity digitalisation platform, it has been designed to efficiently
              enhance productivity and reduce the workload of the operations management who are responsible for safety compliance.
              It will also enable senior managers to comply with legal requirements to maintain and demonstrate safe operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              “TRACE is our new digital platform designed to enhance productivity and reduce the workload of the operations management.
              It will also enable senior managers to comply with legal requirements to maintain and demonstrate safe operations better
              than ever before.” said Sture Lygren, Integrated Operations Lead.
            </p>
            <p>
              Commenting from Eigen, Murray Callander, CEO, said,” “We are extremely pleased with the outcome of the project so far. It
              provides a further benchmark in our mission to enhance industry by delivering innovative and forward-thinking digitalisation
              projects. By understanding the questions that data must answer, applying our experience with real-time systems and carefully
              designing human-digital interaction, we have enabled information to be used to change operational practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is another example of industry applying technology to in-the-field decision-making, resulting in lower costs, increased
              safety and enabling the Fourth Industrial Revolution”.

            <h2>New software to improve safety on Norwegian Goliat field</h2>
            <h3>
Oil and gas technology specialists Eigen are working on new software to improve safety on an offshore Norwegian field.
            </h3>
            <p>
Working with ENI Norge, the firm is developing a barrier status panel for the Goliat field in the Barents Sea.
</p>
<p>
The technology will increase the visibility of asset integrity and risks, which Eigen says will reduce the risk of safety incidents and production losses on the platform.
</p>
<p>
It is also aimed at improving efficiency – allowing engineers to focus on other operational activities.
</p>
<p>
The system is due to enter production in April.
</p>

            <h2>The digitalisation interview: Murray Callander, chief technology officer, Eigen</h2>
            <p>
               Oil prices may be staging a cautious recovery, but the pressure on upstream oil and gas operators to make their operations
              more efficient remains. Central to this process is digital technology, and the effective use of big data. Gas Matters speaks
              with Murray Callander, chief technology officer of digital systems developer Eigen, about the latest digital trends in the
              gas sector and how they are shaping the industry.

                      <h2>Digitalisation in oil &amp; gas – The upstream response to Industry 4.0</h2>
                      <h3>
                        The past decade has seen several Oil &amp; Gas operator technologies advancing quickly in performance and declining rapidly in price.
                      </h3>
                      <p>
Since the turn of this century, productivity growth has become an increasingly prominent government priority. The past decade has seen several Oil & Gas operator technologies advancing quickly in performance and declining rapidly in price, and they are believed to hold the key to enhancing industrial productivity in the sector.  These include IoT, remote sensing, data combination and dissemination, cloud computing, autonomous vehicles, industrial internet, additive manufacture, block-chain, analytics and artificial intelligence. Together they form the foundations of what is commonly referred to as the 4th Industrial Revolution.
</p>
<p>
In line with this revolution, 2017 has seen huge investments into digitalisation in the industry. Statoil unveiled its 1Bln Kroner digitalisation initiative, BP invested $20m in an AI company called Beyond Limits and GE forecast that their digitalisation platform will be part of a $6Bln revenue stream by 2020.
</p>
<p>
All over the world Oil and Gas operators are announcing digitalisation projects, and it’s also interesting that digitalisation now rarely reports to the CIO. instead this technology adoption is owned and driven on commercial imperatives by the COO. No longer is digitalisation seen as a pie-in-the-sky IT project, it has been recognised as a key operations strategy component.
</p>
<p>
So what has changed, what’s happening, why is this important and what should you do about it?
</p>
<h3>Digitalisation</h3>
<p>
The term Industry 4.0 was coined at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2015. It has been the subject of large investments by governments, most notably Germany, which is closely followed by the UK, Norway and USA.
</p>
<p>
Benefits from digitalisation flow quickly. This is has become increasingly relevant to the Oil and Gas industry because low oil prices coupled with aging assets means profitability can only be achieved by making operations more productive. Digitalisation, when done right, captures quick productivity gains and results in tangible benefits that are delivered within specific budget-cycles – and it provides two main areas of benefit:
</p>
<p>
1. It removes waste from activities - translating into reduced costs from man-power, transport, logistics, and warehousing; and
</p>
<p>
2. It reduces the number of activities undertaken through greater understanding of the current situation, options for intervention and confident prediction of outcomes.
</p>
<h3>
Two ways to achieve digitalisation
</h3>
<p>
There are parallel adoption processes underway. The first (operational digitalisation) is practical and delivers immediate benefit, the second (strategic digitalisation) is long term and addresses structural change.
</p>
<p>
Operational digitalisation is action-focused. It revitalises aging assets and increases productivity. It delivers results within each budget cycle. This works because oilfields are already alive with data. With small changes, it is possible to know the up-to-the minute operating environment and risk stance (including the status of barrier functions). This can be used to safely enhance daily routines to cut waste and increase uptime.
</p>
<p>
Strategic digitalisation is a long-term structural approach that focuses on changing the way a plant is designed, built and operated. Strategic initiatives benefit from shared industry standards; however new methods will take time to work through the system and be adopted. These projects tend to be large and company-wide – and they also promise a large impact. Unfortunately, they are not much help to the COO seeking to improve existing plant’s and this year’s operating margin. The pay-off is longer term.
</p>
<h3>
Operational digitalisation leverages what you already have
</h3>
<p>
Alongside spreadsheets for production forecasts, most installations have digital control rooms, collect live equipment performance data, and have computerised maintenance and automated control-of-work systems. Operations use integrated planning, competency registers, rotation plans, warehousing, logistics co-ordination, helicopter schedules and weather forecasts. Integrity is maintained through records of well-integrity, physical inspections and process safety. Well-performance tests are captured and stored.
</p>
<p>
Operations does not lack knowledge about what is going on, nor does it lack knowledge about what to do and how to react. What it misses is the ability to get the right information to the right people so they can make real-time decisions in a complex, interlinked environment.
</p>
<p>
Advances in technology mean it is now possible to easily access, combine and make sense of separate operational data deposits and to infer relations and consequences. This means operations have an opportunity to unlock digitalisation benefits by stitching together what is already available and by making it available to a wider team. Arguably this may not provide all that is promised in the future by the more elaborate AI and Automatic diagnostic systems, but it is practical, provides tangible real-world benefits and is quick. Better yet, it’s not an all-or-nothing bet as it can be deployed incrementally by balancing benefits, achievability and cost at each step.
</p>
<h3>
The six steps to operational digitisation
</h3>
<p>
While there are general similarities between companies and their assets, each has a slightly different technical set-up. Every organisation operates slightly differently and has its own value priorities. Success requires implementing high-impact, valuable activities that cause minimal disruption. The initiatives selected are likely to differ between assets.
</p>
<p>
Finding a valuable approach relies on identifying opportunities to create benefits, understanding current technical capabilities, discovering what people and processes are in place, highlighting options for change and considering what steps would be required to implement. The most valuable approaches are those that balance benefits attainable against technical risk and ease of changing working practices.
</p>
<p>
A general framework for an operational digitalisation programme can be summarised in six steps:
</p>
<p>
1. Fix what you have and still need
</p>
<p>
2. Identify value drivers and magnitude of possible impact;
</p>
<p>
3. Assess digitalisation maturity;
</p>
<p>
4. Propose and select among opportunities, balancing value and risk;
</p>
<p>
5. Implement initiatives based on selected opportunities; and
</p>
<p>
6. Measure impact achieved
</p>
<h3>
Fix what you have and still need
</h3>
<p>
Some plant and equipment measurement systems, especially real-time instrumentation and alarms, become degraded over time because of maintenance backlog and reduced investment. Normal IT services may not be able to address this quickly. Consider updating systems and engaging specialist services to restore existing digitalisation to a healthy state. Specialist companies focusing on real-time control systems can provide a quicker, more knowledgeable service than those available from pure IT companies.
</p>
<h3>
Assess your current situation and select options
</h3>
<p>
A blue-print for assessment using templates, maturity models, and a standardised approach can accelerate steps 2,3 and 4. Many of the large consultancies such as McKinsey, Accenture, PwC, Deloitte and EY have methodologies that can be adapted to Oil and Gas. There are also specialist niche providers like Step Change and V4 Associates who only work in Oil and Gas. Certain software vendors work alongside internal teams to help clients perform these steps in-house.
</p>
<h3>
Implement new technologies and work-practice changes
</h3>
<p>
Proven platform technologies can increase the chances of success at stage 5. There are cases to be made both for specialist providers and for general platforms, provided by the likes of IBM Watson, Microsoft Power BI, Siemens, GE and Oracle. Whilst there is no right or wrong answer, there are a series of trade-offs and future assumptions that should be balanced, and a road-map should be defined to capture immediate benefits without sacrificing longer-term efforts.
</p>
<p>
Implementation does not stop at the technology. There are working practices that will need tuning. Many companies address this themselves without external assistance. No matter how you choose to address it, this step should be carefully planned and resources assigned to it.
</p>
<h3>
Measure the benefits achieved
</h3>
<p>
A rigorous methodology and independent assessment in stage 6 will inform the pace of future investment and control the speed of change. It does this by assuring value is delivered at each step, and learning what methods to change so that operating procedures work best. The parameters for measurement should be agreed prior to implementation and the conduct of the measurement should be free from interference.
</p>
<h3>
Next Steps
</h3>
<p>
If you don’t currently have a digitalisation programme underway, it may be time to examine the opportunities that are available to you. If you are currently executing a digitalisation programme, it may be best to divide the initiatives into operational and strategic so that their approaches and value measures can be managed differently.
