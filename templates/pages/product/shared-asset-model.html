It allows you to connect and link your data together so that it can be viewed in any context.<p>The Shared Asset Model (sometimes called Domain Model) describes how all the data links together. As far as possible the asset model does not replicate data, it points to it in the source system.<p>The model defines objects and relationships based on a class library (such as ISO 15926) and gives fast and stable performance as it scales. Any type of data can be linked. It can be thought of as a relational-graph hybrid as the objects and relationships look much like a graph and can be traversed like a graph but it overcomes the performance limitations of a graph for queries over the entire dataset by using indexing and flattening like a relational database.</div></div></div></div></article>{{footer}}
