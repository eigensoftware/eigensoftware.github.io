              <p>We are working on new ways of modelling and interacting with information to help Oil and Gas companies become much more efficient.&nbsp;
                It's going so well we need someone to help keep the sales team on plant earth and help our amazing team of developers figure

              <p>This role is a unique position and will suit someone with a lot of technical experience but who does not want to go into

                stack and also project delivery and commercial drivers and can help the developers enjoy their jobs and deliver great code,
                while at the same time helping the C-suite understand where there are opportunities to be doing things better and how.</p>

                arm waving pie in the sky), but in addition to this you will also be able to show:</p>
              <ul class="job-list">
                <li>In depth understanding of the full technical stack and associated version control, build, testing &amp; deployment systems</li>
                <li>Good people skills</li>
                <li>Ability to articulate both technical and non-technical ideas</li>
                <li>Maintain up-to-date knowledge of technology standards, industry trends, emerging technologies, and software development
                  best practices by attending relevant conferences and reading widely</li>
                <li>Knowledge and practical application of JIRA and Confluence</li>
                <li>A good Computer Science degree from a recognised University</li>
                <li>Seek opportunities for innovation &ndash; both internally and externally with our clients</li>

                <li>Proficient in some scripting and programming languages (Python, Ruby, Perl, PowerShell, Golang, etc.)</li>
              </ul>
