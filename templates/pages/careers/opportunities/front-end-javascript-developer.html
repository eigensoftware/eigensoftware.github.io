              <p>We need someone with a great eye for design and a &quot;can do&quot; attitude to Front End development combined with solid
                technical ability.&nbsp; We build awesome looking UIs for industrial systems and they get used by very demanding customers
                so they've got to look good and keep working.</p>
              <p>We deal with all kinds of data from live sensors to report and documents and one of the biggest challenges is helping companies
                replace spreadsheets! Every customer is unique and we need to make sure the platform can scale while still being flexible
                and supportable.&nbsp; We build data models that describe how all the information is connected so that we can build more
                intelligent systems that understand context.&nbsp; Our team has done an amazing job so far and we are looking for another
                tenacious technical problem solver to join our team as we grow. </p>
              <p>Our ideal candidate will have a proven track record of creating, maintaining and delivering excellent code in an agile environment.&nbsp;
                The role is primarily JavaScript but demonstrable knowledge of the full stack is an advantage.&nbsp; In this role, it is
                important to be able to iterate rapidly based on user feedback, experiment with different ideas, without losing sight of
                engineering quality. You&rsquo;ll be willing to share your opinion on technical direction, and contribute to the mix of
                ideas.</p>
