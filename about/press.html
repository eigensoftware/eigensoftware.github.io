                      <h3>
                        In collaboration with oil and gas company Lundin Norway, software provider Eigen has designed an app which pairs with wearable devices to provide oil and gas offshore workers with real-time information.
                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        Using the tool, offshore ‘digital’ workers are given instant access to operational data through the app itself or a headset with a visor interface. Information about industrial equipment can be accessed either through image processing or by manually entering search terms, offering data on past or planned maintenance, recently generated alarms, live performance data and documentation.

                        Digital Chris is a very valuable person. He’s what’s referred to as a “Barrel Chaser” he’s the trouble shooter, the ideas man, the guy that gets things done. Digital Chris adds thousands of barrels of production each year. Production that would otherwise be locked up due to process constraints, lost through shut-in’s and trips or lost through delays getting things back on-line. Digital Chris probably contributes a few million pounds of cash that drops straight to the bottom line.

                         How can operators capture greater value through making better digital decisions?

                      <p>
Much has been written about Digitalisation recently but it’s often less clear that different approaches are needed depending on the nature of the business goal.
</p>
<p>
There are essentially two main types of digitalisation - those focused on using data to make co-ordination decisions to sanction and control work (referred to as Digital Decisions), and those that embed information processing so the way work is performed changes (referred to as Digital Execution).

            <h2>Eigen Delivering Enhanced Operational Management at Goliat</h2>
            <h3>Offshore Oil and Gas digitalisation software provider and systems integrator, Eigen, is delivering a new Barrier Status
              Panel to improve the management of operational safety on Goliat.</h3>
            <p>
              Working with ENI Norge, the Barents Sea project will greatly increase the visibility of real time asset-integrity and risk-stance.
              This will help operations to reduce the risk of safety incidents and production losses on the platform. The system is
              due to enter production in April.
            </p>
            <p>
              By implementing the first solution of its kind to restructure the understanding and management of risk, the innovative project
              will eliminate the time required to identify and analyse safety barrier status. This will enable engineers to focus on
              other operationally essential activities, whilst complying with health, safety and environmental policies.

            <h3>
Oil and gas technology specialists Eigen are working on new software to improve safety on an offshore Norwegian field.
            </h3>
            <p>
Working with ENI Norge, the firm is developing a barrier status panel for the Goliat field in the Barents Sea.
</p>
<p>
The technology will increase the visibility of asset integrity and risks, which Eigen says will reduce the risk of safety incidents and production losses on the platform.

            <h2>The digitalisation interview: Murray Callander, chief technology officer, Eigen</h2>
            <p>
               Oil prices may be staging a cautious recovery, but the pressure on upstream oil and gas operators to make their operations
              more efficient remains. Central to this process is digital technology, and the effective use of big data. Gas Matters speaks
              with Murray Callander, chief technology officer of digital systems developer Eigen, about the latest digital trends in the
              gas sector and how they are shaping the industry.

                      <h2>Digitalisation in oil &amp; gas – The upstream response to Industry 4.0</h2>
                      <h3>
                        The past decade has seen several Oil &amp; Gas operator technologies advancing quickly in performance and declining rapidly in price.
                      </h3>
                      <p>
Since the turn of this century, productivity growth has become an increasingly prominent government priority. The past decade has seen several Oil & Gas operator technologies advancing quickly in performance and declining rapidly in price, and they are believed to hold the key to enhancing industrial productivity in the sector.  These include IoT, remote sensing, data combination and dissemination, cloud computing, autonomous vehicles, industrial internet, additive manufacture, block-chain, analytics and artificial intelligence. Together they form the foundations of what is commonly referred to as the 4th Industrial Revolution.
</p>
<p>
In line with this revolution, 2017 has seen huge investments into digitalisation in the industry. Statoil unveiled its 1Bln Kroner digitalisation initiative, BP invested $20m in an AI company called Beyond Limits and GE forecast that their digitalisation platform will be part of a $6Bln revenue stream by 2020.
